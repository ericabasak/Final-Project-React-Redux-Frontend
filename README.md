Welcome to Todo App!

When I was considering apps for my final Flatiron project, I wanted something practical and that I would use myself. As a mother, wife and student, I have 100 things to-do in my head at any given time. What better idea than a to-do list?!

The frontend to my Todo App can be found here:
https://github.com/ericabasak/Final-Project-React-Redux-Frontend

The basic requirements are:
run npm start

Run the app in development mode on the browser:
open http://localhost:3001
