Welcome to Todo App!

Demo link: 

When I was considering apps for my final Flatiron project, I wanted something practical and that I would use myself. As a mother, wife and student, I have 100 things to-do in my head at any given time. What better idea than a to-do list?!

The frontend to my Todo App can be found here:

The basic requirements are:

run npm start

Run the app in development mode on the browser:

open http://localhost:3001
